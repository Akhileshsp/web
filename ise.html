	much needed. <br><br>
	With the support of the Head of Department and the staff of ISE we have
	decided to conduct activities and competitions within our department to
	encourage our fellow students to learn more. Our whole intention of forming an
	association was to make sure students come out of their comfort zone and
	expose themselves to change. <br><br>
	While doing so, we believe that these changes will
	help students during placements, help students become better individuals and
	have a positive impact on themselves and a society as a whole.

<h2> CORE COMMITTEE </h2>
<h5><b>
After spending two monotonous years, with hardly any interaction with our seniors or juniors, we desired a change in the department and that’s how the Core Committee was formed. 
The Core Committee consists of five like-minded people who believe in the notion ‘Kaizen’.<br><br>
Kaizen is a Japanese business philosophy of continuous improvement of working practices and personal efficiency.
We as a team believe that for an individual to change it does not happen overnight but it happens on a continuous long term period where the individual is mostly out of his/her comfort zone.
We want to achieve this by forming Houses and conducting activities and competitions. <br><br> 
<br>We as a team believe in our vision and mission and are ready to embark on this adventurous journey ahead.
<br> A journey which not only helps us discovers ourselves but also help our peers to discover themselves.
<br> Like Steve Jobs once said, “The ones who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.” <br><br>
<b><i>We are the crazy ones. We are the Core Committee :</i></b> <br>
Ashwin Gopinath : <u> Founder and the Head Boy </u> <br><br>
Anant Barlota : <u>Co-Founder and House Captain</u> (Team Operose). <br><br>
Ashish Chopra : <u> Co-Founder and House Captain</u> (Team Instinct). <br><br>
K Shivaprasad : <u>Co-Founder and House Captain </u> (Team Valour). <br><br>
Vinutha R Kamath : <u>Co-Founder and House Captain </u> (Team Mystic).<br> </h5>

<h2>Concept of Houses : </h2>
<h5>
Back when we were studying in schools we were divided into four different Houses.<br> Every competition a student wins, points would be added to the House the student belonged to. At the end of the academic year the House with most points would be declared a winner. By just conducting activities and competitions we felt that students might lose interest with time and that’s the reason we thought to implement the concept of Houses into the department. 
 <br><br>
The whole department is divided into four Houses. <br><br> They are: 1) Red House - Valour 2) Green House - Operose 3) Blue House - Mystic 4) Yellow House -  Instinct <br> </h5>
<br><br>
<h2>Purpose of Houses : </h2>
<h5>
&#10172 &nbsp; Promote teacher-student, student-student interaction. Real education—the substantive development of intellect and character—depends upon sustained personal contact between students and teachers over the long term.  <br>
&#10172 &nbsp; Improve the campus life. This model allows us to renew our campus life and bring excitement in the daily routine of institution education. <br>
&#10172 &nbsp; Genuine diversity - Education and experience that comes from exposure to students with different experiences of life, flourishes within “Houses” that are complete cross-sections of the demography to which they belong. <br>
&#10172 &nbsp; The students can be part of something bigger than themselves - Bring in a sense of belonging . <br>
&#10172 &nbsp; Student Welfare and Self Sustainability .<br>
&#10172 &nbsp; The welfare of and is looked by students; themselves and allow them to  : <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &#9755 Develop soft skills .<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9755 Obliterate hesitation to approach their classmates and faculty .<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#9755 Establish a strong formal and informal network of support. <br> </h5>
